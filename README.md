# KVS
A key/value store I worked on in a team of 3. The KVS reads in JSON form a file and creates a key/value store from it, with String keys and JSONObjects as values.
The KVS can then be written out to storage.
This was our first group project in a series of 3 to be completed throughout the semester which all build on each other.
